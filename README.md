# 🎬 3. Final Project – MongoDB + Cassandra
This is an end-to-end project completed for the course.

# ✔ MongoDB Tasks
- Imported movies.json into the entertainment database
- Query to find year with most movie releases
- Count of movies after 1999
- Average votes for movies released in 2007
- Exported fields into partial_data.csv

#✔ Cassandra Tasks
- Created entertainment keyspace
- Imported partial_data.csv
- Counted rows in movies table
- Created index on rating column
- Counted movies with rating “G”
- All queries, screenshots, and outputs are included in the project folder.
